A demo R Shiny app and development lesson from 2019

Conventions in R Shiny and packages may have changed since the creation of this code. Here are some things that are broken:

This should be the fix for bringing sf into the code in place of sp/rgdal - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61519042/plotting-sf-type-object-in-leaflet-r

Shiny code refers to incorrect data endpoints as of 3/12/24.
